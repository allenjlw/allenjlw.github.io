======
I'm a third year PhD student of CS department in [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). My research interest lies in system security especially in IoT security. Currently, I'm working with Dr. [Dongyan Xu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/) and Dr. [Antonio Bianchi](http://antoniobianchi.me/) in [FRIENDS](https://friends.cs.purdue.edu/) lab. Before joining Purdue, I got my Bachelor's and Master's degree from [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I worked with Dr. [Shanqing Guo]() during my Master's. I also worked with Dr. [Jin Song Dong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) and Dr. [Guangdong Bai](https://baigd.github.io/) for half a year when I visited [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/).
