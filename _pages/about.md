I'm a Ph.D. student in Purdue University [PurSec Lab](https://pursec.cs.purdue.edu/) advised by [Dongyan Xu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/) and [Antonio Bianchi](http://antoniobianchi.me/). My research interest lies in system security especially in IoT security. Before joining Purdue, I got my Bachelor's and Master's degree from Shandong University. I was advised by [Shanqing Guo](http://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/guoshanqing/zh_CN/index/521661/list/index.htm) during my Master's. I also worked with [Jin Song Dong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) for half a year when I visited National University of Singapore.
