Currently, I'm a PhD student of CS department in [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) advised by [Prof. Dongyan Xu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/). My research interest lies in system security especially in IoT security. Before joining Purdue, I got my Bachelor's and Master's degree from [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I was advised by [Prof. Shanqing Guo](http://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/guoshanqing/zh_CN/index/521661/list/index.htm) during my Master's. I also worked with Dr. [Jin Song Dong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) for half a year when I visited [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/).
